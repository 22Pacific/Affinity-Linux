## Introduction
Installation and Usage Guide for Serif's [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/) Graphics Suite on Linux using [ElementalWarrior](https://gitlab.winehq.org/ElementalWarrior)'s Wine fork. This guide is based on [Affinity Wine Documentation by Wanesty](https://affinity.liz.pet/)
and [AffinityOnLinux from twig](https://github.com/Twig6943/AffinityOnLinux).

This guide is an easy to follow step-by-step process on GUI without requiring to build [ElementalWarrior](https://gitlab.winehq.org/ElementalWarrior)'s Wine and without rum.

This guide helps Installing and running Affinity apps on linux as very usable state with opencl (hardware accelaration) enabled for Nvidia users (needs Vkd3d-proton) and with exporting functionality working (adding vcrun2015 by winetricks) on Affinity apps.

(Note: Affinity software version 1.10.4 and later releases require .winmd files from an existing Windows 10+ install.)
